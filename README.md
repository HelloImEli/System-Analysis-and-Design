# System-Analysis-and-Design


Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?

Liam, the owner of DriverPass wants to create a website to train drivers. He believes that so many people are failing driving tests because there is not proper training. For this website, each user will have their own account with a unique username and password. The customers will be able to purchase packages that have different levels of training, that include online training, on the road training, and online tests. Customers will also be able to create, edit, or cancel driver training appointments on the website.

What did you do particularly well?

I think I did well on the Business Requirements Document. This is a very important document to outline the things that the system needs, the purpose of the system, and the objectives and goals.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

I would revise the Gantt Chart that was part of the Business Requirements Document. There is a
lot that could be done to improve it and make it easier to read and understand. The Gantt Chart
I created does what it needs to do, but with a few adjustments and a clearer timeline, it would
be greatly improved.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

In most situations where I am interpreting user’s needs, I put myself as the user. I think about
the things I would want and things that would make the application or website more accessible.
In this project I did that, as well as implement everything that DriverPass stated in the interview.

How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?

The first step in designing software would be to get the requirements of the system. If it is new
system, what is needed? If it is an existing system, what needs to be changed? The DriverPass
interview was a great way to get those requirements. From those requirements, design
documents can then be created. From all of those a working system can then be created. In the
future, I would try to implement all these processes. I believe that together they make creating
and designing a system much easier.
